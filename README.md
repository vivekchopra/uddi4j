# uddi4j

Original source: http://uddi4j.sourceforge.net/

From the blurb *"UDDI4J is a Java class library that provides an API to interact with a UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery and Integration) registry. The UDDI Project is a comprehensive, open industry initiative enabling businesses to (I) discover each other, and (II) define how they interact over the internet and share information in a global registry architecture. UDDI is the building block which will enable businesses to quickly, easily and dynamically find and transact with one another via their preferred applications."*

This is mostly history- UDDI (and UDDI registries) are long since dead. It was fun while it lasted.. thanks to my HP teammates and IBM collaborators.
